I even wonder if I created the file before. Lord help my wife and I. we are working just a little too hard. Lord, what should I do. I need another job. Please Lord, I know you are reading me and listening to my plea. Please My Lord. Our works are like filty rags , Yes, Lord but you are a lord of Mercy, watching and seeing our heart and intentions. please Lord, do something. We are trying to provide for the needy. We would like to do more. Lord help Lord, I pray. Please Lord, this is not me saying that you have not been enough, this is me saying that please take us to the next level. Please provide a job for me.
Lord, I know you have heard me. Help me be closer to thee and praise thee PLEASE Lord
